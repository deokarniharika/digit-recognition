## Handwritten Digit Recognition

**Neural Networks- Handwritten Digit Recognition** </br>
*Language: Python* </br>

The ipynb file has a computer program implementing a neural network that learns to recognize handwritten digits. TensoFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib and Keras are the libraries used here. TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. The accuracy of the model increases if the number of training examples are increased.
